#### With this script, we are going to find out how many hosts in the target are live in 4 tries.
<p> First being the basic nmap command. <br> { nmap -v -n -sn }. </p>
<p> In second try, we will approach the IPs with top 20 TCP ports with Synchronization (SYN) packets and see if they respond to it or not. <br> { nmap -v -n -sn -PS21,22,23,25,53,80,110,111,135,139,143,443,445,993,995,1723,3306,3389,5900,8080 } </p>
<p> For the third try, we will again approach the IPs with top 20 TCP ports but this time with Acknowledgement (ACK) packets and look for their response. <br> { nmap -v -n -sn -PA21,22,23,25,53,80,110,111,135,139,143,443,445,993,995,1723,3306,3389,5900,8080 } </p>
<p> After all this, we will finally approach the IPs with top 10 UDP ports to see if any service is currently running at those ports. <br> { nmap -v -n -sn -PU631,161,137,123,138,1434,445,135,67,53 } </p>
