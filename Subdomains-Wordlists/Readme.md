<h1 align="center">Offensive Subdomains Wordlists Creator</h1>

<h1 align="center">oswc.sh</h1>
This bash script is designed to gather subdomain data from various reputable sources and merge them together to create multiple wordlists, each organized by different subdomain levels, and make a master subdomains wordlist merging all different levels subdomains wordlists. This makes very effective wordlists that can be further used in the subdomain brute-forcing process by security researchers and bug hunters.

<h1 align="center">oswc_2.sh</h1>

This script serves the same purpose as the above script, but uses different tools such as `awk` and `duplicut` instead of `dsieve` and `unfurl`. These tools require less memory, making this script suitable for systems with low RAM. There is no difference in the output of both the scripts
