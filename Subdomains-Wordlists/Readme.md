<h1 align="center">Offensive Subdomains Wordlists Creator</h1>


## Description
This bash script is designed to gather subdomain data from various reputable sources and merge them together to create multiple wordlists, each organized by different subdomain levels, and make a master subdomains wordlist merging all different levels subdomains wordlists. This makes very effective wordlists that can be further used in the subdomain brute-forcing process by security researchers and bug hunters.
